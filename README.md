A bug logger app made with PERN stack hosted on Cyclic.

## Tech used: PostgreSQL, Express.js, React.js, Node.js, Bootstrap.js, JSON Web Token, Bcrypt.js

The focus on this project was to create a CRUD app using a PERN stack in order to both learn new technologies and have a project I could commit most of my time to in order to show my skills as a software engineer.

## Optimizations:
With more time, I would like to add more to the overall application. As of now, I have the basics of which a bug logger app should have. Also, I would like to change the overall theme of the app.

## Lessons Learned:
In this project, I learned an abundant amount of new technologies, terminology, etc. I am now more confident in myself to learn more technologies and being able to implement said technologies into projects I may work on in the future. Also, read documentation.

## Run On Your Local System:
- npm install in both client package.json and server package.json
- npm run build in client package.json
- npm run start in both client package.json and server package.json
